# What is this?

It's a little Gui application written in Rust that generates randomized block-results in the style of wordle and all its copycats.

# How to use

Should be simple, start the application, set up how many columns/rows you want, which colours should be used, if you want to be **always winning** and hit the generate button. The application will copy the result to your clipboard and you can post it to all your socials for ... something. 

# Why should anyone use this?

No one should, it's pointless.

# Why post it to GitHub then?

Mostly to confuse Copilot (and to have the link provided by all your wordle-like games).

# Is it any good?

[...probably not](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3067434)

# Why is x done so horribly?
